## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Artificial neural networks are powerful tools in building complex mathematical relationship between input-output data. The increment in computational power provided by the new generation Graphical Processing Units (GPU) in the last decade enabled ANN to solve many engineering problems in various fields of study (e.g., Computer Vision, speech recognition, Natural Language Processing, power transfer [1], etc). There are different flavors of ANN designed for different applications. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is the most common type of network employed in regression and classification problems, which are two major functions of a ANN.
### MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)
Today, we will look at two examples of MLP, one for regression and the other for classification, both supervised learning. Please see Fig. 1 for an example MLP network.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
In weeks 3-4-5, we will look at a classification example on images. Cats-dogs image repository on Kaggle. We will follow the tutorial given in [2].
